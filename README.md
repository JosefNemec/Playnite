### Code Contributions
Please ask in the related issue first before starting implementing something to make sure that nobody else is already working on it. If an issue doesn't exist for your feature/bug fix, create one first.

Regarding code styling, there are only a few major rules:

- private fields and properties should use camelCase (without underscore)
- all methods (private and public) should use PascalCase
- use spaces instead of tabs with 4 spaces width
- add empty line between code block end `}` and additional expression
- always encapsulate the code body after *if, for, foreach, while* etc. with curly braces:

```csharp
if (true)
{
    DoSomething();
}

DoSomethingElse();
```

instead of

```csharp
if (true)
    DoSomething();
DoSomethingElse();
```

Branches
---------
* `master` - default branch representing state of currently released build.
