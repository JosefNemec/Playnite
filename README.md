### Themes
See [How to: Themes](https://github.com/JosefNemec/Playnite/wiki/How-to%3A-Themes) wiki page.

### Code Contributions
Please ask in an issue first before starting with implementation to make sure that nobody else is already working on it. If the issue doesn't exists for your feature/bug fix, create one first.

Regarding code styling, there are only a few major rules:

- private fields and properties should use camelCase (without underscore)
- all methods (private and public) should use PascalCase
- use spaces instead of tabs with 4 spaces width
- always encapsulate with brackets:

````
if (true)
{
    DoSomething()
}
````
instead of
```
if (true)
    DoSomething()
```
