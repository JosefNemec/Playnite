# Data Backup

> [!NOTE]
> Playnite can create and restore backups only during application startup. This means that manual backup/restore requires Playnite to be restarted and automatic backup can be currently done only on application startup.
>
> This also means that external backup/restore, started via command line, will restart existing Playnite instance.

## Automatic backups

Automatic backups can be configured in application settings under `Backup` section (by default disabled). These backup are currently only possible on application startup and can be configured to be run daily or weekly.

If you need more granular control over when and how backups are started, see [starting backups externally](#starting-backups-externally) section.

## Manual backups

Backups can be created or restored manually from main menu, `Library` section, or via commands from global search view.

## Backup items

| Item | Config value | Description |
| -- | -- | -- | 
| Settings | 0 | Playnite configuration files, specifically `config.json` and `fullscreenConfig.json`. |
| Library | 1 | Core game library files (list of games and other files), excluding game media files (covers, icons etc.). |
| Library files | 2 | Game library media, covers, backgrounds etc. |
| Extensions | 3 | Installed extensions. |
| Themes | 4 | Installed themes. |
| Extensions data | 5 | Extension user data generated by installed extensions. |

## Starting backups externally

Data backup and data restore can be started externally via `--backup` and `--restorebackup` command line arguments. These arguments take full path to a configuration file as an argument. The actual procedure is controlled via settings from the configuration file.

| BackupItems | List of [additional items](#backup-items) (their integer values) to be included in a backup. Settings and core game library files are always included. |
