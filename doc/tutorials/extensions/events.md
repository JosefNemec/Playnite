Example - Handling start/stop events
---------------------

To have a code executed on selected event define function with specific name in your script.

### Game Starting

Following example writes name of currently playing game into a text file.

# [C#](#tab/csharp)
```csharp
public override void OnGameStarted(Game game)
{
    logger.Info($"Game started: {game.Name}");
}
```

# [PowerShell](#tab/tabpowershell)
```powershell
function OnGameStarted()
{
    param(
        $game
    )

    $game.Name | Out-File "RunningGame.txt"
}
```

# [IronPython](#tab/tabpython)
```python
def on_game_started(game):
    with open("RunningGame.txt", "w") as text_file:
        text_file.write(game.Name)
```
***

### Game Stopped

This example writes name of game that stopped running and the time game was running for into a text file.

# [C#](#tab/csharp)
```csharp
public override void OnGameStopped(Game game, double elapsedSeconds)
{
    logger.Info($"{game.Name} was running for {elapsedSeconds} seconds");
}
```

# [PowerShell](#tab/tabpowershell)
```powershell
function OnGameStopped()
{
    param(
        $game,
        $elapsedSeconds
    )

    "$($game.Name) was running for $elapsedSeconds seconds" | Out-File "StoppedGame.txt"
}
```

# [IronPython](#tab/tabpython)
```python
def on_game_stopped(game, elapsed_seconds):
    with open("StoppedGame.txt", "w") as text_file:
        text_file.write("{0} was running for {1} seconds".format(game.Name, elapsed_seconds))
```
