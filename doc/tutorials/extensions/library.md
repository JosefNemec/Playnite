Working with game library
=====================

Introduction
---------------------
Game database API allows you to access and modify game library and its objects (including platforms and emulators). Database API can be accessed via `PlayniteAPI.Database` property, which provides [IDatabaseAPI](xref:Playnite.SDK.IGameDatabaseAPI) interface.

Handling Games
---------------------

### Getting Games

To get list of all games in library use [Database](xref:Playnite.SDK.IPlayniteAPI.Database) property from `IPlayniteAPI` and [Games](xref:Playnite.SDK.IGameDatabase.Games) collection.

# [C#](#tab/csharp)
```csharp
foreach (var game in PlayniteApi.Database.Games)
{
    // Do stuff with a game
}

// Get a game with known Id
var game = $PlayniteApi.Database.Games[SomeGuidId];
```

# [PowerShell](#tab/tabpowershell)
```powershell
# Get all games
$games = $PlayniteApi.Database.Games
# Get a game with known Id
$game = $PlayniteApi.Database.Games[$SomeGuidId]
```

# [IronPython](#tab/tabpython)
```python
# Get all games
games = PlayniteApi.Database.Games
# Get a game with known Id
game = PlayniteApi.Database.Games[SomeGuidId]
```
***

### Adding New Game

To add a new game create new instance of [Game](xref:Playnite.SDK.Models.Game) class and call `Add` method from [Games](xref:Playnite.SDK.IGameDatabase.Games) collection.

# [C#](#tab/csharp)
```csharp
var newGame = new Game("New Game");
PlayniteApi.Database.Games.Add(newGame);
```

# [PowerShell](#tab/tabpowershell)
```powershell
$newGame = New-Object "Playnite.SDK.Models.Game"
$newGame.Name = "New Game"
$PlayniteApi.Database.Games.Add($newGame)
```

# [IronPython](#tab/tabpython)
```python
new_game = Game()
new_game.Name = "New Game"
PlayniteApi.Database.Games.Add(new_game)
```
***

### Changing Game Data

Changing properties on a `Game` object doesn't automatically update the game in Playnite's database and changes are lost with application restart. To make permanent changes game object must be updated in database manually using `Update` method from [Games](xref:Playnite.SDK.IGameDatabase.Games) collection.

# [C#](#tab/csharp)
```csharp
var game = PlayniteApi.Database.Games[SomeId];
game.Name = "Changed Name";
PlayniteApi.Database.Games.Update(game);
```

# [PowerShell](#tab/tabpowershell)
```powershell
$game = $PlayniteApi.Database.Games[$SomeId]
$game.Name = "Changed Name"
$PlayniteApi.Database.Games.Update($game)
```

# [IronPython](#tab/tabpython)
```python
game = PlayniteApi.Database.Games[SomeId]
game.Name = "Changed Name"
PlayniteApi.Database.Games.Update(game)
```
***

### Removing Games

To remove game from database use `Remove` method from [Games](xref:Playnite.SDK.IGameDatabase.Games) collection.

# [C#](#tab/csharp)
```csharp
PlayniteApi.Database.Games.Remove(SomeId);
```

# [PowerShell](#tab/tabpowershell)
```powershell
$PlayniteApi.Database.Games.Remove($SomeId)
```

# [IronPython](#tab/tabpython)
```python
PlayniteApi.Database.Games.Remove(SomeId)
```
***

Handling reference fields
---------------------

Some fields are only stored as references in `Game` object and can't be directly updated. For example `Series` field is a reference via `SeriesId` property, you can't directly assign new value to `Series` property (it can be only used to obtain referenced series object).

### Updating references

Every reference field has it's own collection accessible in [Database](xref:Playnite.SDK.IPlayniteAPI.Database) API object. For example all series can be accessed via [Series](xref:Playnite.SDK.IGameDatabase.Series) collection.

If you want to change name of the series then you will need to do it by updating series item from [Series](xref:Playnite.SDK.IGameDatabase.Series) collection. The change will be automatically propagated to all games using that series. All field collections are implemented via [IItemCollection](xref:Playnite.SDK.IItemCollection`1) meaning that the update is done via the same process like updating general game information via `Update` method on the specific collection.

### Adding references

To assign completely new series to a game:

- Add new series into [Series](xref:Playnite.SDK.IGameDatabase.Series) database collection.
- Assign ID of newly added series to the game via `SeriesId` property.
- Call Update on `Games` collection to update new `SeriesId` in database.

Some fields allow you to assign more items to a game. For example you can assign multiple tags to a game. In that case you need to assign [List](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.collections.generic.list-1) of IDs to `TagIds` property.

Handling Files
---------------------

All game related image files are stored in game database itself, with only reference Id being used on the game object itself (with exception of [BackgroundImage](xref:Playnite.SDK.Models.Game.BackgroundImage), which allows use of WEB URL as well). Following examples show how to handle game images using database API.

### Exporting Game Cover

Game cover images are referenced in [CoverImage](xref:Playnite.SDK.Models.Game.CoverImage) property. To save a file first get the file record by calling [GetFullFilePath](xref:Playnite.SDK.IGameDatabaseAPI.GetFullFilePath(System.String)) method. `GetFullFilePath` returns full path to a file on the disk drive.

# [C#](#tab/csharp)
```csharp
var game = PlayniteApi.Database.Games[SomeId];
var coverPath = PlayniteApi.Database.GetFullFilePath(game.CoverImage);
```

# [PowerShell](#tab/tabpowershell)
```powershell
$game = $PlayniteApi.Database.Games[$SomeId]
$coverPath = $PlayniteApi.Database.GetFullFilePath($game.CoverImage)
```

# [IronPython](#tab/tabpython)
```python
game = PlayniteApi.Database.Games[SomeId]
coverPath = PlayniteApi.Database.GetFullFilePath(game.CoverImage)
```
***

### Changing Cover Image

Changing cover image involves several steps. First remove original image by calling [RemoveFile](xref:Playnite.SDK.IGameDatabaseAPI.RemoveFile(System.String)) method. Then add new image file to a database using [AddFile](xref:Playnite.SDK.IGameDatabaseAPI.AddFile(System.String,System.Guid)). And lastly assign Id of new image to a game.

Following example changes cover image of first game in database:

# [C#](#tab/csharp)
```csharp
var game = PlayniteApi.Database.Games[SomeId];
PlayniteApi.Database.RemoveFile(game.CoverImage);
game.CoverImage = PlayniteApi.Database.AddFile(@"c:\file.png", game.Id);
PlayniteApi.Database.Games.Update(game);
```

# [PowerShell](#tab/tabpowershell)
```powershell
$game = $PlayniteApi.Database.Games[SomeId]
$PlayniteApi.Database.RemoveFile($game.CoverImage)
$game.CoverImage = $PlayniteApi.Database.AddFile("c:\file.png", $game.Id)
$PlayniteApi.Database.Games.Update($game)
```

# [IronPython](#tab/tabpython)
```python
game = PlayniteApi.Database.Games[SomeId]
PlayniteApi.Database.RemoveFile(game.CoverImage)
game.CoverImage = PlayniteApi.Database.AddFile("c:\\file.png", game.Id)
PlayniteApi.Database.Games.Update(game)
```
