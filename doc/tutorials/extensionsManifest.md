Extensions Manifest
=====================

Extension manifest files are used by Playnite to load extensions and display basic information to user on extension settings dialog. Manifest files are mandatory and extension won't be loaded unless valid manifest file is present inside  extension directory under `extension.yaml` file name.

Format
---------------------

Manifest is YAML formated file with following properties:

| Property | Description |
| -- | -- |
| Name | Extension name. |
| Author | Extension author. |
| Version | Extension version. |
| Module | File name of extension module: `*.dll` file for plugins, `*.ps1` or `*.py` file for scripts. |
| Type | Extension type, available values are: `Script`, `GenericPlugin`, `GameLibrary`. |
| Icon | Optional relative file name of extension icon. |

If you want to add executable script method into Playnite's main menu then `Functions` property has to be also specified. This only applies to script extensions since compiled plugins specify external functions directly.

Function properties:

| Property | Description |
| -- | -- |
| FunctionName | Name of the script function, function must not accept any parameters. |
| Description | Text description displayed on the exported menu entry. |
