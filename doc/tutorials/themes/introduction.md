# Introduction to Themes

General information
---------------------

Playnite's user interface is implemented using Windows Presentation Framework (WPF) and UI definition is done using [XAML](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/framework/wpf/advanced/xaml-overview-wpf) files. Custom themes in Playnite are implemented using [standard template and styling](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/framework/wpf/controls/styling-and-templating) support that WPF provides, therefore any tutorial that applies to styling in WPF also applies to Playnite.

Fullscreen and Desktop modes
---------------------

Playnite offers two separate modes of operation. Standard `Desktop` mode designed for keyboard and mouse and `Fullscreen` mode designed to be controlled with gamepad. These two modes are implemented completely separately and therefore themes are also completely separate.

Learning resources
---------------------

Since Playnite themes are essentially just set of [template and style](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/framework/wpf/controls/styling-and-templating) files, general editing rules and tutorials that apply to WPF also apply to Playnite.

Recommended WPF resources:
* https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/framework/wpf/advanced/xaml-overview-wpf

Creating Playnite themes
---------------------

There are generally two approaches to theme creation in Playnite.

1. **[Manually editing](manualEditing.md)** XAML files using any text editor.

2. **[Using Blend/Visual Studio](usingDesigner.md)** designer.

Option #1 doesn't require installation of any additional applications and themes can be generally created even using Notepad. However this approach has major disadvantages:
* You don't get live preview of changes your are making.
* You have to restart Playnite every time a change is made to theme files.
* There's not autocompletion or error checking for XAML syntax.

Option #2 requires installation of [Visual Studio IDE](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/), Community edition is free to download and includes [Blend](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/designers/creating-a-ui-by-using-blend-for-visual-studio?view=vs-2019) editor. This approach takes some time to set up, but offers all advantages that manual editing lacks, like live preview, autocompletion of XAML properties, visual editor etc. 

**Using Blend editor is recommended option.**
