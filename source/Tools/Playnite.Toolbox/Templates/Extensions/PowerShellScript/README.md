Check out https://api.playnite.link/docs/tutorials/extensions/scripting.html for documentation on creating a script plugin!

Note - **Support for PowerShell extensions is getting removed in next major Playnite release, version 11. We strongly recommend using .NET plugins since porting PowerShell script code to C# would be considerable amount of effort.**

Once you're done, update the installer yaml, then submit a PR to https://github.com/JosefNemec/PlayniteAddonDatabase
